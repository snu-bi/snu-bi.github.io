My current research goal is to design *a **cognitive agent** that can **understand the dynamic environment** through **active interactions***.  
To achieve this, an agent should deal with critical problems such as lack of additional information, data imbalance, distribution shifts, and physical embodiment limitations. Specifically, my research topics include:

- Representation learning in realistic environments (with class imbalances, distribution shifts, …)  
- Online learning & Active learning, *Curiosity*  
- Few-shot generalization  
- Score-based models and Optimal transport
