In the short term, my focus is on the gradual replacement of human labor through robotics and AI-based systems in real-world logistics and manufacturing. I aim to build machines that operate quickly, reliably, and continuously, taking over repetitive, hazardous, and high-precision tasks.

In the mid term (2030s), I am drawn to developing android robotics capable of natural and intuitive interaction. This decade marks a turning point: human-like qualities reach their highest value, yet it is also the last era in which being “human-like” holds genuine meaning. My goal is to engineer robots that embody the extreme limits of the humanity people expect.

In the long term (2040s), I seek to transcend the boundaries of AI, robotics, and neuroscience in pursuit of a form of general intelligence that surpasses both the structural constraints of biological protein differentiation and the physical limits of computer emulation—ultimately contributing to the next stage of evolution.

I believe that meaningful innovation arises from a synthesis of academic rigor and practical deployment. My interest lies in balancing research with societal mechanisms like entrepreneurship to turn transformative ideas into real-world impact.
