In the short term, I aim to achieve breakthroughs in overcoming fundamental challenges of physical AGI — including reducing the excessive reliance on demonstration data in VLA models, enabling robust task generalization, and developing effective mechanisms for episodic memory.
 
In the long term, I seek to transcend the boundaries of AI, robotics, and neuroscience, in pursuit of a form of general intelligence that surpasses both the structural constraints of biological protein differentiation and the physical limits of computer emulation.

I believe that meaningful innovation arises from a synthesis of academic rigor and practical deployment. My interest lies in balancing research with societal mechanisms like entrepreneurship to turn transformative ideas into real-world impact.

I'm always open to creative and meaningful discussions or collaborations in AI and robotics—whether with companies, universities, or research groups. If you're working on something exciting, feel free to reach out!
