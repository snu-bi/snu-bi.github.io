# **SNU Biointelligence Lab**

Welcome! **Biointelligence Lab** (바이오지능 연구실), led by Professor **Byoung-Tak Zhang**, is part of the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU).

Our research focuses on
- **Embodied AI**
  - We build intelligent robotic agents capable of sensorimotor learning, grounded reasoning, and lifelong adaptation in dynamic environments.

- **Fundamental AI Research**
  - We explore self-motivated AI systems that autonomously identify problems, generate hypotheses, gather information, and solve tasks through active and sequential learning.

- **Multimodal AI**
  - We develop models that integrate vision, language, and action, enabling robots to perceive, understand, and interact with complex, multimodal environments.
